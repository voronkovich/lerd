# Changelog

All notable changes to Lerd will be documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Lerd uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## [0.1.24] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd.test` proxy vhost now uses `host.containers.internal` instead of the Podman network gateway IP — the gateway IP is typically blocked by the host firewall for connections from containers, while `host.containers.internal` is a Podman built-in that always routes to the host correctly

---

## [0.1.23] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- Dashboard service start now writes the Quadlet file and reloads systemd before calling `systemctl start`, fixing "Unit not found" error on first use
- Service action errors are now returned as JSON with the error message and last 20 lines of `journalctl` logs
- Frontend shows a loading spinner while toggling, "Started successfully" / "Stopped" flash on success, and an inline error with expandable logs on failure

---

## [0.1.22] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd.test` dashboard now reachable: UI server changed to listen on `0.0.0.0:7073` so nginx (running inside the Podman container) can reach it via the network gateway IP
- `lerd install` now reloads nginx after writing the `lerd.test` proxy vhost so it takes effect immediately without a manual restart
- `lerd.test` is now a reserved domain — `lerd park` silently skips any directory that would resolve to it, `lerd link` returns an error if the resolved domain is reserved

---

## [0.1.21] — 2026-03-17

### Added

- **Lerd dashboard** — browser UI available at `http://lerd.test`, served by `lerd serve-ui` as a persistent systemd user service (`lerd-ui.service`)
- Dashboard shows three tabs: **Sites** (table with domain links, PHP/Node version, TLS badge, FPM status), **Services** (start/stop toggles, copy `.env` button per service), **System** (DNS, nginx, PHP-FPM health, auto-refreshes every 10 seconds)
- **Update flow** built into the UI: "Check for update" button in sidebar checks GitHub releases; if an update is available shows the version and an "Update" button that runs `lerd update`
- `lerd install` now writes and starts `lerd-ui.service` and generates the `lerd.test` nginx reverse proxy vhost; prints `Dashboard: http://lerd.test` on completion
- `lerd start` / `lerd stop` include `lerd-ui` alongside DNS, nginx, and PHP-FPM

---

## [0.1.20] — 2026-03-17

### Changed

- `lerd stop` now also stops all installed services (those with a quadlet file) in addition to DNS, nginx, and PHP-FPM
- `lerd start` now also starts all installed services

---

## [0.1.19] — 2026-03-17

### Added

- `lerd php:rebuild` — force-removes and rebuilds all installed PHP-FPM images; useful after a Containerfile change
- `lerd update` now automatically runs `lerd php:rebuild` after `lerd install` so PHP-FPM image changes (new extensions, config tweaks) are applied on every update

---

## [0.1.18] — 2026-03-17

### Added

- `lerd logs` — show PHP-FPM container logs for the current project (auto-detects version)
- `lerd logs -f` / `--follow` — tail logs in real time
- `lerd logs nginx` — show nginx container logs
- `lerd logs <service>` — show logs for any service (e.g. `lerd logs mailpit`)
- `lerd logs <version>` — show logs for a specific PHP-FPM container (e.g. `lerd logs 8.5`)
- PHP-FPM containers now route all PHP errors to stderr (`catch_workers_output`, `log_errors`, `error_log=/proc/self/fd/2`) so they appear in `podman logs` / `lerd logs`

---

## [0.1.17] — 2026-03-17

### Added

- `mailpit` service — local SMTP server with web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:8025`; catches all outgoing mail from Laravel apps
- `soketi` service — self-hosted Pusher-compatible WebSocket server for Laravel Echo / broadcasting
- PHP 8.5 support — `lerd use 8.5` builds and starts the PHP 8.5 FPM container; default PHP version updated to 8.5

---

## [0.1.16] — 2026-03-17

### Added

- `lerd php [args...]` — runs PHP inside the correct versioned FPM container, detecting version from `.php-version` / `composer.json` / global default
- `lerd artisan [args...]` — shortcut for `lerd php artisan [args]`
- `lerd node [args...]` — runs Node via fnm with auto-detected version
- `lerd npm [args...]` — runs npm via fnm with auto-detected version
- `lerd npx [args...]` — runs npx via fnm with auto-detected version
- `lerd install` now writes `php`, `composer`, `node`, `npm`, `npx` shims to `~/.local/share/lerd/bin/` so commands work directly from the terminal

---

## [0.1.15] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- Service `.env` variables now use container hostnames (`lerd-mysql`, `lerd-redis`, etc.) instead of `127.0.0.1` — PHP-FPM runs inside the `lerd` Podman network so `127.0.0.1` resolves to the container's own loopback, not the host

---

## [0.1.14] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- nginx `resolver` directive added to `nginx.conf` using the Podman network gateway so upstream container hostnames are re-resolved dynamically after FPM restarts (previously nginx cached the old IP and returned 502)
- `fastcgi_pass` in vhost templates now uses a `$fpm` variable to force use of the resolver
- `lerd install` now regenerates all registered site vhosts so template changes are applied immediately
- PHP-FPM containers now use a locally built image (`lerd-php{version}-fpm:local`) with all Laravel-required extensions pre-installed: `pdo_mysql`, `pdo_pgsql`, `bcmath`, `mbstring`, `xml`, `zip`, `gd`, `intl`, `opcache`, `pcntl`, `exif`, `sockets`, `redis`, `imagick`
- PHP-FPM images are built automatically on first `lerd use <version>` — subsequent runs reuse the cached image

---

## [0.1.13] — 2026-03-17

### Changed

- `lerd service start` / `lerd service restart` — `.env` output is printed without leading whitespace for direct copy-paste

---

## [0.1.12] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd service start <service>` — automatically writes the quadlet file and reloads systemd before starting, so services work on first use without needing a prior `lerd install`

### Changed

- `lerd service start` and `lerd service restart` now print the recommended `.env` variables to add to your Laravel project after the service starts

---

## [0.1.11] — 2026-03-17

### Added

- `lerd start` — start DNS, nginx, and all installed PHP-FPM containers
- `lerd stop` — stop DNS, nginx, and all installed PHP-FPM containers

---

## [0.1.10] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- Nginx and PHP-FPM containers now mount the user's home directory so project files are accessible inside the containers
- `nginx.conf` — added `user root;` and changed pid/error_log to writable paths (`/tmp/nginx.pid`, stderr) so nginx starts correctly in rootless Podman without `UserNS=keep-id`
- PHP-FPM pool now runs workers as root (`-R` flag + `zz-lerd.conf` override) so it can read project files in the home directory
- `ensureFPMQuadlet` — always overwrites the quadlet file (previously skipped if it existed, leaving stale configs in place)
- `lerd install` — now regenerates all existing PHP-FPM quadlets so config changes are applied without manual deletion
- `EnsureNginxConfig` — always overwrites `nginx.conf` (previously skipped if file existed)

---

## [0.1.9] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd-dns.container` quadlet template was embedded from the wrong source directory (`internal/podman/quadlets/`) — the file still referenced `andyshinn/dnsmasq` with `Network=host`, causing the DNS container to fail with "Permission denied on port 53"; updated to the Alpine-based dnsmasq on port 5300 via published port
- `dns.Setup()` and `ensureUnprivilegedPorts()` — `sudo` subprocesses now have `Stdin/Stdout/Stderr` connected to the process terminal so password prompts display correctly instead of failing with "a terminal is required"

### Added

- `lerd unpark [directory]` — removes a parked directory and unlinks all sites registered from it

### Changed

- `lerd park` and `lerd link` — directory names with real TLDs (`.com`, `.net`, `.org`, `.io`, `.ltd`, etc.) now have the TLD stripped and remaining dots replaced with dashes before appending `.test` (e.g. `admin.astrolov.com` → `admin-astrolov.test`)
- `lerd use <version>` / `lerd status` — PHP version detection now tracks FPM quadlet files instead of static CLI binaries, so `lerd use 8.4` is immediately reflected in `lerd status`

---

## [0.1.8] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd update` now automatically runs `lerd install` after swapping the binary, so quadlet files, DNS config, sysctl settings and any other infrastructure changes are applied without the user having to run a second command

---

## [0.1.7] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd-dns.container` — removed `Network=host` and `AddCapability=NET_ADMIN` which both fail under rootless Podman; container now runs dnsmasq on port 5300 via a published port (`127.0.0.1:5300:5300`)
- `lerd install` — now checks `net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start` and automatically sets it to 80 (with sudo) so rootless Podman can bind nginx to ports 80 and 443; also writes `/etc/sysctl.d/99-lerd-ports.conf` to persist across reboots

### Changed

- `lerd status` — every FAIL entry now shows an actionable hint (e.g. `systemctl --user start lerd-nginx`, `lerd service start mysql`, `lerd use 8.4`)

---

## [0.1.6] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `lerd install` was calling `dns.WriteDnsmasqConfig` (writes only the container's local config) instead of `dns.Setup()`, which means `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/lerd.conf` and `/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/lerd.conf` were never written and NetworkManager was never restarted — causing `*.test` DNS resolution to silently fail
- `dns.Setup()` now prints a clear message before invoking `sudo` so users know why a password prompt appears

---

## [0.1.5] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `install.sh` — definitively fixed the `install: cannot stat '...\033[0m...'` error by refactoring `download_binary` to accept a caller-supplied directory instead of returning a path via stdout; all output now goes directly to the terminal (stderr) and is never captured by command substitution

---

## [0.1.4] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `install.sh` — `install: cannot stat '...\033[0m...'` error: `download_binary` was called inside `$()` command substitution so its `info` output was captured into the `binary` variable along with the path; all UI output in `download_binary` now goes to stderr, leaving only the path on stdout
- `install.sh` — tar extraction errors inside `download_binary` now also go to stderr and produce a clean error message instead of polluting the captured path

---

## [0.1.3] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `install.sh` — `BASH_SOURCE[0]: unbound variable` still occurred on bash versions where `${array[0]:-default}` triggers `set -u` when the array itself is unset (not just empty); fixed by suspending `nounset` briefly with `set +u` before reading `BASH_SOURCE`

---

## [0.1.2] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `install.sh` — `BASH_SOURCE[0]: unbound variable` crash when the script is piped to bash (`curl|bash` / `wget|bash`); `BASH_SOURCE` is unset in that execution context so it now defaults to `$0`

---

## [0.1.1] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- `install.sh` — replaced `[[ ... ]] && main "$@"` guard with `if/fi` so the script sources cleanly under `set -euo pipefail` (the `&&` idiom exits with code 1 when the condition is false, which `set -e` treated as fatal)
- `install.sh` — `latest_version` no longer exits non-zero when the GitHub API returns no `tag_name` (e.g. curl failure or no releases yet)

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-17

Initial release.
