# AI Integration (MCP)

Lerd ships a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server, letting AI assistants (Claude Code, JetBrains Junie, and any other MCP-compatible tool) manage your dev environment directly — run migrations, start services, toggle queue workers, and inspect logs without leaving the chat.

---

## Injecting the config

Run this once from a Laravel project root:

```bash
cd ~/Lerd/my-app
lerd mcp:inject
```

This writes five files:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.mcp.json` | MCP server entry for Claude Code |
| `.claude/skills/lerd/SKILL.md` | Skill file that teaches Claude about lerd tools |
| `.ai/mcp/mcp.json` | MCP server entry for Windsurf and other MCP-compatible tools |
| `.junie/mcp/mcp.json` | MCP server entry for JetBrains Junie |
| `.junie/guidelines.md` | Lerd context section for JetBrains Junie (merged, not overwritten) |

Each config includes a `LERD_SITE_PATH` environment variable pointing to the project root. This means tools like `artisan`, `composer`, `env_setup`, and `db_export` don't need an explicit `path` argument when called from within that project — the server uses `LERD_SITE_PATH` as the default.

The command **merges** into existing configs — other MCP servers (e.g. `laravel-boost`, `herd`) are left untouched. Re-running it is safe.

To target a different directory:

```bash
lerd mcp:inject --path ~/Lerd/another-app
```

## Available MCP tools

Once the MCP server is connected, your AI assistant has access to:

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `sites` | List all registered lerd sites (name, domain, path, PHP/Node version, framework, worker status) |
| `runtime_versions` | List installed PHP and Node.js versions with configured defaults |
| `artisan` | Run `php artisan` in the PHP-FPM container — migrations, generators, seeders, cache, tinker |
| `composer` | Run `composer` in the PHP-FPM container — install, require, dump-autoload, etc. |
| `node_install` | Install a Node.js version via fnm (e.g. `"20"`, `"lts"`) |
| `node_uninstall` | Uninstall a Node.js version via fnm |
| `env_setup` | Configure `.env` for lerd: detects services, starts them, creates DB, sets APP_KEY and APP_URL |
| `site_link` | Register a directory as a lerd site — generates nginx vhost and `.test` domain |
| `site_unlink` | Unregister a site and remove its nginx vhost |
| `secure` | Enable HTTPS for a site using a locally-trusted mkcert certificate |
| `unsecure` | Disable HTTPS for a site |
| `xdebug_on` | Enable Xdebug for a PHP version and restart the FPM container |
| `xdebug_off` | Disable Xdebug for a PHP version |
| `xdebug_status` | Show Xdebug enabled/disabled state for all PHP versions |
| `service_start` | Start a built-in or custom service; if the service has `depends_on`, dependencies start first and dependent services start after |
| `service_stop` | Stop a built-in or custom service; cascade-stops any custom services that depend on it first |
| `service_add` | Register a new custom OCI-based service (MongoDB, RabbitMQ, …); supports `depends_on` for service dependencies |
| `service_remove` | Stop and deregister a custom service |
| `service_expose` | Add or remove an extra published port on a built-in service (persisted, auto-restarts if running) |
| `service_env` | Return the recommended `.env` connection variables for a built-in or custom service |
| `db_export` | Export a database to a SQL dump file (defaults to site DB from `.env`) |
| `queue_start` | Start the queue worker for a site (any framework with a `queue` worker) |
| `queue_stop` | Stop the queue worker |
| `reverb_start` | Start the Reverb WebSocket server for a site |
| `reverb_stop` | Stop the Reverb server |
| `schedule_start` | Start the task scheduler for a site |
| `schedule_stop` | Stop the task scheduler |
| `worker_start` | Start any named framework worker (e.g. `messenger`, `horizon`, `pulse`) |
| `worker_stop` | Stop a named framework worker |
| `worker_list` | List all workers defined for a site's framework with running status |
| `framework_list` | List all framework definitions including their workers |
| `framework_add` | Add or update a framework definition; use `name: "laravel"` to add custom workers to Laravel |
| `framework_remove` | Remove a user-defined framework; for `laravel` removes only custom worker additions |
| `site_pause` | Pause a site: stop all its workers and replace its vhost with a landing page |
| `site_unpause` | Resume a paused site: restore its vhost and restart previously running workers |
| `service_pin` | Pin a service so it is never auto-stopped even when no sites reference it |
| `service_unpin` | Unpin a service so it can be auto-stopped when unused |
| `stripe_listen` | Start a Stripe webhook listener for a site (reads `STRIPE_SECRET` from `.env`) |
| `stripe_listen_stop` | Stop the Stripe webhook listener |
| `logs` | Fetch container logs — defaults to current site's FPM; optionally specify nginx, service name, PHP version, or site name |
| `status` | Health snapshot of DNS, nginx, PHP-FPM containers, and the watcher — use when a site isn't loading |
| `doctor` | Full diagnostic: podman, systemd, DNS, ports, PHP images, config, updates — use when the user reports setup issues |

## Example interactions

`LERD_SITE_PATH` is set automatically by `mcp:inject`, so `path` is omitted from most calls.
